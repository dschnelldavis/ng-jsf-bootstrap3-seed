# Angular JSON Schema Form Bootstrap 3 Seed App

This example app shows how to generate a Bootstrap 3 form from a JSON Schema using Angular JSON Schema Form.

The app was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

To create this app yourself, enter the following commands in your terminal:
```shell
ng new ng-jsf-bootstrap3-Seed
cd ng-jsf-bootstrap3-Seed
npm install angular2-json-schema-form
```

Then edit the following files:

* src/index.html — load external Bootstrap JavaScript and CSS
* src/app/app.module.ts — load Angular JSON Schema Form module
* src/app/app.component.ts — set schema and data variables to configure form
* src/app/app.component.html — display form with `<json-schema-form>` tag

## Development server

Run `ng serve`, then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the form.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
